# Shopify Developer Intern Challenge
I was tasked with building an inventory tracking web application for a logistics company with CRUD functionality.

**Key Milestones:**
- Created SQL Schema
- Deployed PostgreSQL database on AWS EC2
- Built responsive frontend in React
- Created model & controller, wrote queries (with consideration for pagination), and connected it to the frontend

**Additional Features for Future Builds:**
- Improve front end - from styling to creating a filterable table
- Allow user to have the option of pagination in the front end, as I've built an items query with pagination in mind 
- Allow deletion comments and undeletion
- Provide ability to create "shipments" and assign inventory to the shipment

## Getting Started

1. Download dependencies with:

   > `npm install`

2.  Set up `.env` file using `example.env`

    > `.env` requires Postgres config

3. Run with:

   > `npm run dev`
 
4. PostgreSQL set up
   > install PostgreSQL if needed and run schema file in `/PostgresSQL/schema.sql`

## Technologies and Tools
1. Node.js
2. Express
3. PostgreSQL
5. Amazon EC2 
6. React
